## Building and installing

1. Run `python setup.py bdist_wheel` from the root of the library to build it.
2. The newly built wheel file should now be stored in the dist subdirectory. Install it with `pip install /path/to/wheelfile.whl`
3. Happy training! 🏃

## Samples

A few sample methods are provided and can be run to help get the idea of how to use this library. These sample methods are located inside `samples.py` and are not included in the library builds.
